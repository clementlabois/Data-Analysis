## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list data analytics projects and briefly describe the technology stack used to solve the cases.

### Project 1 : Medical Data Analytics Tuberculosis Trends in XRay Patients
**Code:** https://github.com/clementlabois/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Project-1

**Goal:** identify and understand key patterns and potential correlations between patient attributes (such as symptoms, age, gender, smoking history, and previous TB history) and tuberculosis diagnosis

**Description:** This synthetic dataset comprises 20,000 chest X-ray records categorized as either "Normal" or "Tuberculosis." It was specifically designed to support the training and evaluation of classification models in medical image analysis. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for developing machine learning and deep learning algorithms aimed at detecting tuberculosis from radiographic data. 

### Project 2 : Global Temperature Project DataScientest - Interactive Data Dashboard - Power BI
**Code:** https://github.com/clementlabois/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Project-2

**Goal:** Analyze the evolution of global temperatures and CO‚ÇÇ emissions over time in order to understand the correlation between human activity‚Äîespecially fossil fuel consumption‚Äîand key climate change indicators, across different continents and decades.

**Description:** As part of my Data Analyst Bootcamp at DataScientest, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Quentin Dusautoir, Nizar Mensi, and Jessica Renaudet on a high-impact, socially relevant project: analyzing the evolution of global temperatures and CO‚ÇÇ emissions over time.
Using trusted sources like Our World in Data and NASA‚Äôs GISTEMP dataset, we aimed to better understand the correlation between human activity, fossil fuel consumption, and climate change indicators, across different continents and over several decades.

**App:** https://projetpy-mwjtk9yhgbrrrwrfv5vp7b.streamlit.app/

### Project 3 : Books to Scrape ‚Äì Interactive Data Dashboard
**Code:** 

**Goal:** Automate data extraction from an e-commerce-style website and build an interactive dashboard to visualize product metrics and textual patterns based on book data.

**Description:** This project is based on Books to Scrape (https://books.toscrape.com/), a mock e-commerce platform designed for practicing web scraping.
Using Selenium and BeautifulSoup, I created a scraper that collects book data (title, price, rating, category, and URL). The data is then visualized using Streamlit in a dashboard that includes both numeric and textual analysis.

**App:**
